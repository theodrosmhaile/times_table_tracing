## Formatting data for GraafTel. 
To run user data with GraafTel a minimum of three columns are needed that specify **Student ID**, **Question ID** and **Accuracy** *in that order*. Accuracy should be between 0 and 1.
**Column headers should be removed** and the file should be saved as .csv. 
Each row should contain data points for one student in one question item, (i.e., it should be in long-form). 
Question ID can be any alpha-numeric string but strings shorter than ~5 print better in the application. Additionally, short descriptive labels for question IDs will help in identifying what the question contains.
